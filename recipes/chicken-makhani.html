      Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani (pronounced [mʊrɣ
      ˈməkʰaːni]), is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. It is a type of curry
      made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its
      sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka
      masala, which uses a tomato paste.
